# Jurgdens-Cool-Scanner
A super duper fast, multi-threaded port scanner. 

When I say fast.. I mean it! Use all the threads you have locally available on your equipment and scan thousands of ports at a lightning fast rate! 

first `pip install pyfiglet` for the project

then input the ip of which you want to portscan..

and there it is! simple.

cool right?
